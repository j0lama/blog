title: How to clone a car key
---

Recently, a friend told me that he had bought a USB antenna to see the TV on the computer (R820T2) and that this antenna can capture traffic in a big frequency range, not only TV range. This antenna can capture frequencies of garage and car keys although it is designed to TV frequencies.

With this info I decided to buy one of this TV antennas that are very cheap, only 10$ ([R820T2 TV antenna](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/FW1S-New-USB-2-0-Digital-DVB-T-SDR-DAB-FM-HDTV-TV-Tuner-Receiver-Stick/32600825233.html?spm=a2g0s.11045068.rcmd404.2.266956a4uWrjNg&pvid=54eedbd9-24c7-42a3-9eed-ab60d3f9f07c&gps-id=detail404&scm=1007.16891.96945.0&scm-url=1007.16891.96945.0&scm_id=1007.16891.96945.0))
